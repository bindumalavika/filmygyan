She undergoes rigorous training under Indian intelligence agent Khalid Mir (Jaideep Ahlawat) before being married off to Pakistani Army officer Iqbal Syed. On the other side of the border, Sehmat gradually assimilates into Iqbal’s family to uncover vital information while keeping her real motives hidden from them.Vicky Kaushal’s nuanced turn gives Iqbal a charming sincerity as he tries to balance his attention between Sehmat’s natural appeal, and the love for his country. Iqbal’s father, played by Shishir Sharma, lends a commanding presence to Brigadier Syed as a man committed to his official duties over his family. Back home, Rajit Kapoor makes his mark as Hidayat who reluctantly chooses his daughter’s destiny, placing the devotion of his country above all else. Of course, there’s an undeniable delight in seeing Soni Razdan play mother to her real-life daughter onscreen. Arguably, the film’s most substantial relationship is between Khalid and Sehmat. Jaideep Ahlawat tactfully plays Khalid as a stoic patriot who deliberately restrains his concern for Sehmat. They share an underlying bond of unease mingled with mutual respect that is tangible even when they’re not onscreen together. Director Meghna Gulzar uses this tension to further the intrigue around the interpersonal drama, thrilling us with explosive emotions rather than gun-toting action.Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy’s music lends credibility to the 70’s backdrop. The songs evoke patriotism without tipping over into nationalism, primarily enhanced by Gulzar’s lyrics. The production design by Subrata Chakraborty and Amit Ray along with Maxima Basu Golani's costume design further solidify the film’s authenticity, although a few cinematic liberties in the screenplay might take you out of it at specific points. Nevertheless, Alia Bhatt's stellar performance keeps you invested in ‘Raazi’. Her transition from the gullible girl to a determined woman is subtle. Alia keeps Sehmat’s true alliance hidden just under the surface from her new family, but fortunately, in full view of the audience. Amidst all the compelling performances, this is Alia’s film as she continues to push her boundaries as an actor while challenging our expectations of her. In the same vein, ‘Raazi’ defies the spy genre’s traditional expectations of full-blown action sequences. Instead, Meghna Gulzar’s steady hand gradually ramps up the tension throughout, leading to an explosive final act in this strong dramatic thriller. It also leaves you questioning the repercussions of war on the human psyche.",

                    "p1":"This time, Ranjith uses Rajinikanth the Superstar to tell his message — land is the common man's right. The story is simple... Migrants from Tamil Nadu settle in Dharavi and help build it, and run the city. When an evil politician-cum-land mafia don sets his eyes on their land, they revolt. Do they succeed?Kaala begins with an animated story-telling device similar to Bãhubali, wherein the importance of land and the suppression of the downtrodden by the power-hungry is shown. The film quickly shifts to the present day, in live-action multi-colour (with black being the prominent hue). We are shown evil politicians and land mafia hatching plans to destroy the slums of Dharavi to make it Digital Dharavi and Pure Mumbai (an obvious reference to some of the actual government schemes). We get a casual, but sweet introduction of the Superstar, as Kaala (short for Karikaalan). However, the pace picks up when it is established that he is the King of Dharavi and no one messes with him. The love track between Zareena (played beautifully by Huma Qureshi) and Kaala initially seems to go the Kabali-Kumudavalli way, but Ranjith is quick to realise his folly and sets up a beautiful dinner scene featuring the ex-lovers, where Kaala clarifies his priorities. Watch out for an amazing performance by the two actors here. The pre-interval block has a typical masala stunt sequence that is staged on a Mumbai flyover (with some VFX coming to the aid). This scene reminds you of the Rajinikanth of yesteryear. A big treat for his fans. Sparks start flying once the antagonist Hari Dada (played with a menacing charm by Nana Patekar) enters the scene. The interval scene is a scream.What follows after the interval is somewhat predictable, with Hari Dada seeking revenge and depriving Kaala of his loved ones. But slowly, Ranjith brings in his style of filmmaking. He talks about how the oppressed continue to be suppressed unless they protest against the establishment. Kaala does exactly that. He asks his people to use their body as weapon — telling his people to shut Mumbai down by going on a strike as the slum dwellers in effect run the city as taxi drivers, municipality staff, hospital staff and so on. Mumbai comes to a standstill. Hari Dada seeks revenge. Ranjith gives a spin to the classic white-is-pure-and-black-is-evil logic. Here, Ram is bad and Ravan is good. Watch out for the confrontation scenes between Nana Patekar and Rajinikanth. They are total paisa vasool. Hearing Rajini speak in Hindi and Marathi at times will be a delight for his fans. Special mention should go to Easwari Rao (as Kaala's wife, Selvi) and Anjali Patil (as Puyal, the girlfriend of one of Kaala's sons). You will fall in love with their characters. The theme song, which, by now, is hugely popular is where Ranjith stamps his brilliance as a writer and director, carefully feeding the appetite of Rajinikanth fans. This would be remembered as one of the best climaxes in a Rajinikanth movie. Ranjith owes to his excellent technical crew (cinematographer Murali, music director Santhosh Narayanan, editor Sreekar Prasad and art director Ramalingam) for helping him visualise and deliver this 51% Rajini-49% Ranjith movie.",

                    "p1":"The strength of Dhadak lies in its brimming freshness and innocence. That this film presents the new faces of Ishaan (one film old) and Janhvi (who marks her debut in Bollywood) works in the favour of its narrative. Like its original inspiration, Nagraj Manjule’s Sairat, the facet of love trying to survive the cruel world of politics and ruthless societal pressure, makes Dhadak engaging. The film follows the Sairat template for most part, but what is lacks is the grit and detailing of Manjule’s original. Set in Udaipur, the story begins with young love blossoming in the midst of politics and a dominant class system. Parthavi (Janhvi) is the daughter of a local politician Ratan Singh (Ashutosh Rana), while Madhukar (Ishaan) is the son of a restaurant owner who comes from lower economic strata. Against societal norms, Madhu and Parthavi fall in love, and when her influential family finds out, they tear the lovers apart. The spirited young couple still find a way to elope. The film moves from Udaipur to Mumbai to Kolkata, which is a departure from the original. It's an engaging journey, but the treatment isn't consistent throughout.With Dhadak, Shashank Khaitan steps out of the ‘Dulhania’ mould for the first time. Yet, his third outing has a lot of visual similarities to his earlier films. Owing to the source material, Dhadak is without doubt, his darkest film. He presents the naïve romance with sensitivity, even while fusing the story with ample dramatic highs. Oddly, for the subject at hand, the film looks a little too polished and slick. Even while the lead pair is struggling to make both ends meet, their fashion quotient always remains high. They rent a cramped, one-room house, but they step out looking prim and propah in almost every situation. For a film that stems from harsh reality, this glossed over aspect makes it unbelievable. When it comes to the performances, Ishaan’s personality has the energy and zest of a newcomer, while his performance displays the cool confidence of a seasoned actor. He is pitch perfect in dramatic scenes and his puppy eyes keep the innocence of this love story alive. Janhvi looks radiant and beautiful, and her innocence catches the eye. Well, she does come across a little too raw in comparison to her co-star, especially in dramatic scenes that demand a powerful performance. It's her first film, so she's still rough at the edges, but it's a good start. Shridhar Watsar, who plays Inshaan's vertically challenged friend, is a laugh riot, and Ashutosh Rana as the menacing father and political figure is perfectly intense. The music of the film is a definite highlight. Ajay-Atul pulls the right strings for this one, two tracks from Sairat have been reinvented, one of which is the huge hit Zingaat. The background score of the film (John Stewart Eduri) is designed interestingly and it blends in with the setting of this story. The film also has some stunning cinematography by Vishnu Rao, who makes a pretty picture out of the landscapes of Udaipur. While the editing is crisp in the first half, the pace slackens a bit in the latter parts. While Parshya and Archi’s love story in Sairat was made with great honesty, realism and depth, giving us a perspective of the deep rooted prejudices in our society, Dhadak touches upon them too, but it merely skims the surface. Perhaps more attention to detail and delving a little deeper into the subject, would have given the film an edge. The lead up to the climax creates palpable tension, and the ending is hard-hitting, leaving you with enough to think about. With all its strengths and weaknesses, Dhadak attempts to highlight some shocking truths about our society and for that it makes a worthy watch. ",

                    "p1":" Based on a Sufi poem of the same name written in 1540 by Malik Muhammad Jayasi, Sanjay Leela Bhansali has added his own flair and interpretation to ‘Padmaavat’, giving it a fairy-tale sheen. This makes all the controversy pointless, and pale in comparison to the spectacle that unfolds. Bhansali reunites with two of his favourite leads in recent times – Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh, but adds Shahid Kapoor to complete this trio of commendable acting talent.Shahid is steadfast and unflappable as Maharawal Ratan Singh – the ruler of Mewar, brimming with Rajput pride. He brings a regal aura to the character that warrants him winning the confidence and loyalty of the Mewar kingdom and more importantly, Rani Padmavati’s heart. Deepika is radiant as the Rajput Queen whose beauty, brains and valour moves the entire plot along once Alauddin Khilji becomes obsessed with her. Padmavati’s allure beyond the superficial is prominent post-interval, when her character comes to life and she gets to showcase her acting range. Ranveer as Alauddin Khilji is seen as an unhinged, barbaric Sultan, who is consumed with a ravenous libido for power and flesh. He unleashes an animal magnetism on screen with a scarred face, kohl-lined eyes and a greased torso. The scenes between him and Shahid are some of the most engrossing, as both flex their acting muscles at opposite ends of the moral spectrum. Besides them, Aditi Rao Hydari stands her ground as the naive Mehrunissa who gets a rude awakening when she discovers her husband Alauddin’s true nature. Jim Sarbh is somewhat misplaced as the Sultan’s slave-general, unable to generate enough menace to overshadow his master’s own. Nonetheless, the ensemble moves well in tune with Bhansali’s vision of this larger-than-life retelling.The director’s expertise in heightening opulence and grandeur is well-known, further distinguishable in 3D. Cinematographer Sudeep Chatterjee compliments him by beautifully capturing some jaw-dropping scenery. However, the effects in the action/ war scenes don’t meet the expectations raised by a film of this scale. Also, the songs don’t do much to further the narrative other than providing visual delight. Granted, it could do with a tauter screenplay and shorter run-time but ‘Padmaavat’ is an entertaining, large canvas experience, brought to life with Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s stroke of visual brilliance.

Whether you’re educated or civilized, women have always had to play second fiddle in the male-dominant system. The world would certainly, do well to give women far more respect. To see such a pertinent conversation unfold in a horror-comedy like Stree, is a unique experience. But, it feels a bit jarring, when a film that pokes fun at horror film ideas and entertains the audience with its quips, suddenly bursts out into a comment on feminism. In a bid to be socially relevant, Stree ends up being a little too preachy.Misplaced, good intentions aside, the writing for this genre-bender is very good, especially in the dialogues department. Horror comedies are a rare offering in Hindi cinema and in that respect, Stree serves up a lot of thrills and spills. The small-town setting and the many jibes at horror film legends are hilarious. The funniest character in the film is Pankaj Tripathi’s Rudra, a bookshop owner and Mr know-it-all, who guides Vicky and his friends on how to cope with Stree and her haunting act. Tripathi’s comic timing is top notch and one of the veritable highlights of the film. Rajkummar’s performance is just as good. He handles the many shades of comedy, horror and romance (in a brilliant throwback scene to Shah Rukh Khan) with great ease. Aparshakti Khurrana and Abhishek Banerjee as the friends offer good comedic punches too. Shraddha Kapoor’s character is a bit of an enigma. Even though the role is problematic, the actress does a fine job of maintaining an air of mystery.Stree does fairly well with the comedy, but even with several laugh-out-loud moments, the film feels a little too long. Towards the end, the movie drops the horror comedy treatment and becomes a little too serious about the conventional stabbing-the-ghost-in-the-heart kind of ideas that often play out in horror flicks. Also, it doesn’t add up that a film trying to advocate respect for women, has a song called Kamariya, where men dance around a skimpily clad Nora Fatehi.Despite all its flaws and ambiguous ideas, Stree is still an entertaining film. This is an experimental comedy, that creates an eerie atmosphere and it manages to be funny and scary at the same time. Writers Raj and DK (who have directed films like Go Goa Gone, 99 and Shor In The City) bring in their trademark humour. The film has its absurdities, it also has its moments but the final act let’s it down. ",

Not a single movie, barring Konkona Sensharma’s track in Ek Thi Daayan, came close to Ramu’s cult classics, let alone outshining them. Anushka’s third film and perhaps her strongest work as a producer-actor, Pari has the ability to redefine the genre as it’s refreshingly different, atmospheric and moody.Unlike most mainstream horror films, there’s no jarring background score, cliched jump scares, excessive conversation between characters or dramatic ‘possessed by evil spirit’ performances. Pari is an art-house, indie thriller which moves at its own pace, in its own unique way. It collates elements that are rare to find in commercial scary movies — eerie silence, haunting yet soothing melancholic music, an enchanting love story and an air of paranoia that grips you slowly and steadily.Led by a fine set of actors — Anushka Sharma, Parambrata Chatterjee and Rajat Kapoor infuse substance to the story with their understated act and ensure it doesn’t fall flat even when the pace drops. A headphone scene in particular will be remembered as one of the best sequences in a horror film for years to come.The art direction deserves a special mention, too. From lonely roads and bylanes of Kolkata, thunderous rains, dark and isolated houses to flickering lights and ghostly curtains… the setting sends shivers down your spine. The makeup and special effects are thankfully not comical or over the top and immensely contribute to making Pari, a mysterious and suspenseful creepy thriller.If you like horror as a genre, and prefer a genuine theme over sheer succession of scary sequences, you will find this one fascinating as it isn’t bound by the diktats of commercial cinema.",

His confessions and recollections to Winnie are intimate and give us deep insights into the highs and lows of his life, which is nothing short of a roller-coaster ride. Like any Rajkumar Hirani film, Sanju blends humour with drama effortlessly. While it doesn't reveal much about the protagonists’ relationships and marriages, it does tell a strong story of an unbreakable bond between a father, son and a best friend. In fact, Sanjay’s relationship with his father Sunil Dutt (Paresh Rawal) forms the major part of this story and some of the most heart wrenching and touching moments in the film belong to both of them.Manisha Koirala as Nargis Dutt (Sanju’s mother) has a brief role, but the scenes between the father, mother and son move you to tears. There’s also his best friend Kamlesh (Vicky Kaushal) who's one of the most important characters in the graph of the story and he leaves a solid impact. Maanyata (Dia Mirza) his wife’s strong presence is felt right throughout the film, but his previous marriages have been completely left out of the narrative. Even the birth of his first child, daughter Trishala doesn’t feature in this heart-rending story. The absence of these aspects of Sanju’s life leave the viewer craving for a tad bit more. The first half is extremely gripping, with Sanju struggling with his inner demons. The second half is spent on elaborating his court cases and it reiterates the thought that he’s not a terrorist. The fact that Sanjay Dutt’s real life presents great material for a story on celluloid is unquestionable. Hirani beautifully taps into some deep emotions that keeps the audience drawn to the screen. Even though the film feels long, the film industry nostalgia and the many references to old Hindi film music keep you hooked on. Ranbir Kapoor is just as good as his reputation. To state that he's an incredible actor who fills Sanjay Dutt’s role with gravitas and spunk is stating the obvious. That's expected from a talented actor like Ranbir. But what he does best in Sanju, is that he delivers the central character's swag and nonchalance in the most effortless manner. Whether he's dancing like a hysterical man, with bloodshot eyes under the influence of drugs or he’s the broken, emotional wreck just staring blank, Ranbir portrays a variety of emotions and grey shades with flair. He's the heart and soul of this film. One of the finest performances in the film comes from Vicky Kaushal. He stands tall and pulls off a superb act as Ranbir’s best friend who stands by him like a rock.AR Rahman, Rohan-Rohan and Vikram Montrose’s music sets mood right. Songs like Kar Har Maidan Fateh and Ruby Ruby add to the experience of the film. The background score is top notch too. The drugs infused phase of Sanju’s life is the most impressive and it has been portrayed with the right amount of sensitivity. It has some fantastic visuals and some crazy emotions too.Presenting a biopic on a man with so many shades and one who's lived a life of such extremes is a no mean feat. Hirani, in his signature style, takes you through Sanju's remarkable journey with the finesse and commitment it needs. In the film, Sanju's wife says that he's the king of bad choices, and Hirani's idea of making a film on his life has certainly paid off. Yes, there’s a lot missing, but even then, this is still an incredible story of a man and a movie star who made massive mistakes, walked through fire, survived it and lived one heck of a life.  ",

Through Padman, R Balki tells the real life inspiring story of Arunachalam Muruganantham (played by Akshay Kumar), a social entrepreneur from Coimbatore, who invented low cost sanitary napkins in India, despite the massive opposition and humiliation he was subjected to. The director changes the film’s setting to Maheshwar, Madhya Pradesh, while retaining the core of his courageous story.Given the constant mention of statistics pertaining to the inadequate percentage of women who use pads in India, and reiteration of the film’s issue based motive, Padman often seems like a Public Service Advertisement parading as a commercial film. In order to appeal to the lowest common denominator, things are over-explained and all of this results in a sluggish progression of events. However, given how awkward women are made to feel even today while buying sanitary pads from a medical store, this social drama makes for an important film that needs to be watched.Having said that, in portions, Balki struggles to maintain a balance as it’s not easy to entertain, spread awareness and sensitize people about the issue, all at one go. His semi-humorous and urban outlook at a predominantly rural issue, isn’t seamless as the script often meanders but he redeems himself in scenes that convey a lot more through unspoken words. A quiet moment when Gayatri realises Lakshmi’s concern for her after she sees her brother abusing and neglecting his wife’s health is heart-breaking. Lakshmi’s reaction to his first consumer’s feedback is equally moving. The ‘superhero’ of the film — Akshay Kumar, makes you wonder why he continues to be one of our most underrated actors, despite such immense body of work. He going as far as wearing a pink ladies underwear and a pad to prove a point, goes on to show how actors are willing to push boundaries and embrace their screen characters for the films they believe in. Radhika Apte portrays her part beautifully, making her character relatable to the section of women, who still face such societal taboos. Sonam Kapoor too lights up the screen with her candour and makes her presence felt in a significant role. Known for making films that work towards bridging the age and gender gap, Balki’s Padman is an empowering film that gives you the wings, despite the odds. It will free women of their inhibitions and that will be its biggest success. Period! ",

                    "p1":"He couldn’t become Mohammad Rafi, but harbours a dream of his daughter becoming Lata Mangeshkar. Prashant Sharma (Anil Kapoor) popularly known as Fanney Khan among his gulley friends, works hard to make ends meet, idolises Shammi Kapoor and lives only for his dream of superstardom. He fails to achieve that and hence pins his hopes on his new-born, even naming her Lata (Pihu Sand). Now in her teens, Lata not only sings well but also dances like a dream despite her plus size that regularly makes her an object of body shaming on stage.Anil Kapoor hits all the right notes as a beleaguered father, who is often reprimanded by his own child for being so unflinchingly dedicated in his mission to see her succeed. He strikes the right balance for a middle class man in Mumbai struggling between dreams and reality. This even as his wife Kavita (Divya Dutta) continues to be his empathetic voice of reason. As a debutante, Pihu Sand captures the vulnerability of her character, but one never understands her constant grouse against her father. As the hotshot singer Baby Singh, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan looks befittingly gorgeous, but her storyline is etched without much effort or logic. The talented Rajkummar Rao as Prashant’s trusted friend Adhir, shows his usual flair within a limited scope. While Rajkummar’s chemistry with Aishwarya seems forced, his comic timing comes to the rescue. Film’s narrative goes slightly out of tune in second half. For example, there is no real backstory for Baby Singh and the only person in her life is a creepy manager, who wants her to stage a wardrobe malfunction for a reality show.While the second half is long and laborious, earnest performances keep the boat afloat. For a musical, Fanney Khan’s soundtrack doesn’t live up fully except the Achche Din song which is pleasant and the finale song that exudes energy.Overall, ‘Fanney Khan’ is a star studded musical that starts on a high note and has its moments of glory. It shows how parents live their dreams through children.It does strike a few wrong chords to culminate into an emotional yet convenient climax. However, the showstopper is clearly Anil Kapoor with a knockout performance that makes ‘Fanney Khan’ worth a watch.",

                    "p1":"Middle-class families are often riddled with their own set of values and social systems. While pregnancy and motherhood are celebrated, subjects like sex and romance are talked about with a degree of embarrassment and awkwardness. The concept of 'Badhaai Ho', where a quintessential Delhi couple; parents to two adult boys (one of them is of marriageable age), get pregnant out of the blue, is just the sort of subject that can ruffle-up feathers within the middle-class family system. Yet, this dramedy, based on children feeling terribly embarrassed by the outcome of their parents’ mid-age romance; with outsiders joining in the criticism, conveys some really progressive thoughts. The situational humour of 'Badhaai Ho' is complimented perfectly, by striking performances from Gajraj Rao, Neena Gupta and Ayushmann Khurrana. This film is as funny as it is liberal. The conversation around the fact that romance and passion have nothing to do with age, make this film a stand out for many reasons. The Kaushiks live in Delhi’s Lodhi colony, a run-of-the-mill setting, where family affairs can tumble into the next home through adjoining balconies and windows. So, when Jeetender and his wife Priyamvada find out about their unexpected pregnancy, the news spreads like wildfire. Neighbours get curious, but the knee-jerk reactions come from members of the Kaushik household. The two sons are shocked by the fact that their parents still have an active love life (read: sex life), while the grandmom (Surekha Sikri) is appalled by the news, too. Steering clear of clichés and stereotypes, the writing of Shantanu Srivastava and Akshat Ghildial brings in some genuinely likeable moments. The way the parents break the news to their family is hilarious. Priyamvada’s colony friends feel happy for her, while her own children are almost left red-faced by the news. The on-screen romance between the parents, replete with 80s and 90s romantic songs playing in the background, is absolutely endearing. The well-crafted dialogues add to the hilarity of the situations.You don’t expect actors playing ‘mom and dad’ to have as much screen space as the young leads of the film, but director Amit Ravindernath Sharma actually puts the spotlight on senior actors Gajraj Rao and Neena Gupta. Their romantic moments are the veritable highlight. Same goes for their performances, too. Neena Gupta is excellent in her portrayal of the unsettled mother. Gajraj Rao’s performance is the best thing about 'Badhaai Ho'. In fact, he steals every scene that he’s a part of. Just his body language, mannerisms and expressions are enough to make you laugh out loud. Not to be overshadowed, Ayushmann, too, is in top-form, playing the son who feels the brunt of the social pressure. So much so, that his relationship with his girlfriend, Reene (Sanya Malhotra) gets affected, too. Surekha Sikri, who plays the dadi, deserves a special mention. She’s old-fashioned for various reasons, but when it comes to taking up for her bahu with a baby bump, she unabashedly tells the rest of the family that it’s admirable for couples to be in love and have “sexy” (meaning sex) at this age. Sanya Malhotra, who plays the girl with modern outlook, breezes through her role.'Badhaai Ho', much like its subject, puts a fantastic new spin on the usual. In a new-age rom-com, you’d expect Ayushmann and Sanya’s love story to take centre stage, but when you see the middle-aged parents blush with romance, the entertainment really becomes novel. The music by Tanishk Bagchi, Rochak Kohli and JAM8 is top-grade, too. Tracks like 'Badhaiyaan Tenu', 'Naina Na Jodeen' and 'Sajan Bade Senti' fit the mood perfectly. The film engages thoroughly, while still making a social statement. Even though the story has a limited scope, the detailed writing, the finesse of Sharma’s direction and some unforgettable performances, make this film an absolute winner. ",
