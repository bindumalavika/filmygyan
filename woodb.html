Shah Rukh Khan plays the titular character of a spectacled goon who hates being called “battery”; he starts from harmless Ponzi schemes but graduates to pre-planned rackets and becomes the top bootlegger of his town. When ACP Majmudar (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) is posted in his area, he meets his equal. Raees forms a nexus with politicians who fuel his business, but he soon becomes the thorn in their side.The first half is well-paced; it draws you in and makes you root for the bootlegger; Majmudar’s one-liners and the music whet your appetite and the Laila Main Laila sequence ups the ante. But the second half plunges into a weird Robin Hood zone where the antihero’s morals are suddenly defibrillated and he becomes a messiah. The movie takes a rough path there on, and the long runtime makes the ride bumpier.Shah Rukh Khan has never looked better; he’s full of fury and for once, isn’t spreading his arms, but breaking others’. The film lies entirely on his shoulders and he carries the weight most of the times. When he doesn’t, the ever-so-reliable Nawazuddin Siddiqui steps in with his crackling performance. In the trademark Nawaz style, he delivers some comic relief while playing the Tom to Khan’s Jerry. Mahirah is restricted to songs and a few emotional scenes, but doesn’t really add much. If her purpose was to soften the baddie, it’s lost on the viewer.The movie can feel a bit long, but if you’re going for a great Shah Rukh performance and some good ol’ popcorn-entertainment, it might just ‘raees’ to the occasion."

                "p1":"The story picks up from where the first film in the franchise left off. Indian RAW agent Tiger (Salman Khan) and ISI agent Zoya (Katrina Kaif) are married and living a peaceful life with their son. Eight years have gone by since they decided to choose love over their missions. But their plans will change very soon, with another mission (most impossible) coming up for this sota hua Tiger.Tiger’s ex-boss Shenoy (Girish Karnad) tracks him down and wants him to rescue 25 Indian nurses who are held hostage at a hospital by a dreaded terrorist organisation that has taken over Iraq. From here, it’s a Salman Khan show all the way with his star power and screen presence looming large, ably aided by Katrina Kaif who jumps into the fray as 15 Pakistani nurses who are also held hostage with the Indians need to be rescued. The other USP of this mission is, that Tiger brings together Indian and Pakistani agents to fight terror in Iraq, for the sake of humanity. And, not surprising then that there is a fair sprinkle of patriotic one-liners, too. And all this is happening with oodles of swag and style. (Obviously!)The film is visually stunning in parts and Salman Khan plays Tiger with roaring confidence and dialogues packed with punch. Of course, his fans get a true-blue Salman Khan moment when he bares his torso. However, the screenplay often loses focus, slackening the film’s pace and our attention. Director Ali Abbas Zafar had a lot of ammo in hand, with the star power of Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif adding to that. But the direction falters and he is unable to keep you riveted through the film’s runtime. Supporting actors that make up the rescue mission team are competent and Paresh Rawal delivers a dependable performance. Katrina Kaif gets into action-girl mode, displaying some kick-ass stunts. Meanwhile, the antagonist, Abu Usman (Sajjad Delafrooz), heading the terrorist organisation, is effective in his role.With such a premise, the storyline needed to be far more compelling and the editing much tauter. Needless to add, a lot of sequences defy logic, but at the same time, there are many moments that will leave Salman Khan and action film fans impressed."

                "p1":"Golmaal is the screwball comedy franchise that has been kept alive for the last eleven years. Reruns on satellite channels always make you chuckle, no matter from which point you catch the film. Like its previous instalments, this one too has moments of unadulterated fun. The gags alternate between being truly funny and averagely routine but you find yourself laughing uncontrollably because each of the actors here is a delight to watch. Whether it’s the lisping Lakshman (Shreyas) or the bully Gopal, who is petrified of ghosts, everyone is so proficient, you can’t help but smile at their antics. The dialogue is pedestrian but witty.Of course then you have the additional horror angle thrown in. Drawing inspiration from the South film Kanchana, where a ghost is out to seek revenge, these parts too are treated lightheartedly making you guffaw at situations that you may have seen many times over. However, in the second half, when the actual plot is introduced, proceedings get slightly dull.Here one must say, it is to Rohit Shetty’s credit that he never lets you get too fidgety. Gags, fights, songs, giggles, ghosts, here is a buffet you can overdose on. At times, you actually admonish yourself for being stupid but you can't help but guffaw. As far as performances go, Tabu as the 'exorcist’ lends credence to a part, which could have otherwise looked ridiculous. The add-on members — Vasuli Bhai (Mukesh) and Pappi (Johny Lever) have their moments too but Shreyas is the scene-stealer. Parineeti (Khushi/Damini) is just required to distract, which she does. And regulars, Ajay, Arshad, Tusshar and Kunal keep their end of the bargain. If you are looking for substance, then this one has no logic, only magic. But, if you’re looking to just laugh and be merry, Golmaal will again do the trick. "

This is a question, 25-year-old Natasha keeps asking a haunted mirror, an exhibit that is waiting to be auctioned in the gallery she works at.Standing there in front of this object she so despises, she recalls her childhood--when her parents, father Alex (Adil) and her mother Lisa (Lisa), her brother Kabir and their pet Rambo were so blissed out. But she also vividly remembers how things took a turn for the worse, when their dad brought home a `haunted’ mirror. Egged on by the resident ghost in the mirror Ana(Madalina)her father actually shoots her mother. In turn, her brother shoots her father. Quite naturally their lives are torn asunder. Kabir is committed to psychiatric care. Natasha herself is left fending for herself.A determined Natasha and reticent Kabir plan to destroy the object of their misery. But as it turns out, the mirror itsefl has other plans in store for them.Adapted from the Hollywood horror film Oculus (2014), Dobaara allows for some moments of fear, apprehension, dread and trepidation. Borrowing the template of the original, this paranormal thriller uses flashback as a technique to spook the audience and it is definitely a notch above the desi horror films of yore. Things play out twice--once when Natasha and Kabir are children and again when they are older, but some of the spooky bits are unintentionally funny. The background score jars and the pace is dreary because it depends too much on repetitive dialogue. This one had the potential to be more, but it seems so stretched that you are almost willing to tear the screen yourself and attempt to silence someone."

                "p1":" Badrinath Ki Dulhania is a rucksack full of radioactive social issues handled cautiously with bedazzled Dharma gloves. But ‘handled’ is the operative word here.Set in small towns like Jhansi and Kota where patriarchy is as evident as daylight, the movie focuses on Badrinath (Varun Dhawan), a sahukar’s son in pursuit of a bride. He spots Vaidehi (Alia Bhatt) at a wedding and starts wooing her. But Vaidehi refuses to bow down to social pressure and succumb to a marriage nurtured by an IV drip of dowry. Turns out she’s that mutant small-town girl with actual opinions and ambitions and most importantly, a spine.And her character is the backbone of this story, too. She’s fierce and real; she’s pushed down but gets back up; she protects her dreams and for once, doesn’t get emotionally manipulated. Her father’s heart condition be damned! Through Vaidehi, the movie checks all the important boxes: gender issues, feminism, consent, etc. But the story is treated so stylistically (with elaborate song sequences and flashbacks and cinematic moments) that it loses heat. At times, characters speak like public service announcements, and seem a little contrived.The runtime doesn’t help either. This is a story with an obvious climax, so sitting through two and a half hours to find out what you already know might get uncomfortable. But the breezy vibe of the movie and back-to-back hilarious lines should get you through it.Together, Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt are the best thing that could have happened to our screens. The beautiful effortlessness of their onscreen companionship plasters a grin on your face. Dhawan as Badri is adorable; you instantly take to him. He even pulls off some high-drama scenes impressively. Bhatt, unsurprisingly, gives it her all, and her sincerity comes through. But her accent, casually swinging between Juhu and Jhansi, is bothersome at times.RSVP Yes to this wedding; it’s grand, with good music, great people and delicious food for thought."

                "p1":"The assumption that many have read Chetan Bhagat’s 2014 novel of the same name should be a safe one because Bhagat’s fluff has its own following. But, Half Girlfriend is definitely not one of his best works. So, Mohit Suri (Aashiqui2, Ek Villain) gives us a celluloid outing that is thodafun and largely exasperating.The fun bit comes from watching the Simrao boy (pronounced bai) struck by a thunderbolt when he spots the Delhi dame. And the brave attempts chalk makes in going for cheese is also endearing. Imagine this; he can barely speak a smattering of English and she behaves like she is a rather late-in-the day British import. Yet, it’s understandable that they find an escape in basketball and music. Before long, Madhav’s infatuation becomes a fatal attraction. His college-buddy Shailesh (Vikrant Massey, pitch-perfect performance) warns him of the danger of driving into a one-way street but Madhav, who is perennially in Majnu mode by then, pays no heed.The frustrating bit for Madhav and for the audience is that Riya is commitment-phobic. Her dost se zyada but girlfriend se kum stance seems non-negotiable and stops you from investing in her halfway through the film.Back to apna Madhav, fate smiles on him a couple of times later when his path crosses that of Riya’s. And he chases her from Patna to New York (even dragging Bill Gates into proceedings) with a doggedness that should appeal to the countless stalkers, who shame society every day.The first half breezes through, but post interval proceedings hang; in tandem with the hangdog expression worn by the hero. Arjun is sincere, but seems too urban for an ideal `Bihari’ fit. And Shraddha, who looks her loveliest here, lacks gravitas.As far as the ensemble music album goes--Manoj Muntashir’s Phir Bhi Main Tumko Chahoonga, the only track that has real recall is lyrically-adequate but Mithoon’s tune is not compelling enough. Finally, half girlfriend or boyfriend is that person many of us have encountered on campus. However, do we really want to relive those memories? It depends entirely on the mood."

                "p1":"When Aamir Khan backs a film, you expect quality. The actor who plays an obnoxious music director, Shakti Kumaarr, in this outing, doesn’t let you down on that count. Debutant director Advait Chandan, who schooled under Aamir gives you a simple heartfelt film (slightly `fairytalish' at times) but one in which you run the entire gamut of emotions — joy, tears, excitement and ebullience.PHOTOSNothing is new here. Whether it is batting for the girl child or freeing a battered housewife from the shackles of a loveless marriage, the material at hand has been touched on earlier. But what makes 'Secret Superstar' stand out is the adventurous narrative that keeps you rooted and guessing. You can feel the frustration of the Malik household in which not just people, even emotions are trapped. When the protagonist breaks free, you find yourself simultaneously wiping your tears and doing a victory lap.Aamir is the scene-stealer. His character — a cross between the brash American Idol judge Simon Cowell and your crass Bollywood music directors from the 80-90s — appears like a caricature at the start. But you invest in him eventually because of the nuances he brings. It is also commendable that he never really attempts to steal the limelight from young Zaira, who is an absolute delight to watch. Najma (Meher) as the submissive wife says so much without spelling it out. And others like — Chintan (Tirth Sharma) and child-actor Guddu (Kabir) are adorable.Amit Trivedi’s music is pleasing but the score doesn’t have the winning quality needed for a film like this. The lyrics by Kausar Munir just about pass muster.If you world revolves around your mother, you’re going to root for this film. Go for it girls. "

                "p1":"There’s a been a recent spate of Bollywood movies devoid of its typical glamorous sheen with a focus on the lives of middle-class suburban Indian households. Ad director turned filmmaker Suresh Triveni takes this into consideration in his big screen debut while writing the story around Vidya Balan as Sulochana or ‘Sulu’, a housewife whose achievements aren’t typically noteworthy, but that doesn’t stop her from dreaming big. When presented with a rare opportunity, her subsequent decisions & actions affect her husband, son and immediate family. As a testament to Triveni’s ability as a writer, Sulu doesn’t lose her identity as she begins to experience the corporate media life as an RJ, walking the tightrope between her overnight fame and managing her domestic demands.Vidya Balan is completely in her element, infusing Sulu with an abundance of infectious optimism without being aggravating. She makes Sulu appealing by bringing out the various shades of a woman who has put her personal ambitions on hold because of her family. It also helps that she is surrounded by strong performances all around, in those playing her colleagues and loved ones. Manav Kaul, in particular, is perfectly cast as Sulu’s husband Ashok – a man trying his best to make his wife happy, but also faces work pressure that gets deflected into anger. Also, her family isn’t too thrilled about her sweet-talking potential creeps on a nighttime show which fuels the drama around Sulu’s new career.The sudden shift from being lighthearted to a serious drama is largely where the film falters. Until then, there are entire sequences, especially with her colleagues which are thoroughly entertaining but don’t eventually add up to much. We spend a lot of time looking through Sulu’s lens, and while there’s a lot to fun stuff to savour there, thanks to Vidya – this crucial conflict emerges well into the film’s runtime, at a point where her voice is just starting to be heard in the world. Fortunately, the tonal shifts are not too jarring to disconnect from the story which is easily accessible. A majority of the urban populace will relate to the challenges faced by Sulu and her family, as we all struggle to live out our dreams of a better life. The essence of this story is ‘Main Kar Sakti Hai’, and with such a refined and affable actress as Vidya Balan in the lead, it is lovingly captured in ‘Tumhari Sulu’ making it an entertaining watch for the whole family."

                "p1":"BKB is a hooray moment for Hindi cinema. This romcom set in the North Indian town of Bareilly, breaks the shackles of Bollywood’s continued dependence on cardboard cuts and instead introduces you to real people, whose charms are infectious. The writers Nitesh Tiwari (director and writer of the much-acclaimed blockbuster Dangal )and Shreyas Jain have put together a sweet, identifiable crowd-pleaser that excels in the writing, direction, acting and music departments.As far as performances go--Rajkummar Rao is the scene-stealer. Whether he's the stammering sari salesman or the gali ka gunda, he is magnetic.Kriti Sanon makes for a lovable Bitti and beti, while Ayushmann goes from white to grey so effortlessly you stay invested in him. Pankaj Tripathi and Seema Pahwa are also in fine fettle and you're actually tempted to ask them for an encore.Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari who won notices for her directorial debut Nil Battey Sannata, is in top form again. She puts heart into this comedy and the flawless writing makes it that much more effective.Every time you guffaw at the antics of the lead and supporting cast, you are reminded that there is so much humour in our daily routine which we have forgotten to stop and savour.Coming back to the protagonist, Bitti, she’s the only daughter of a sweetmeat shop owner (Pankaj) and his conservative wife (Seema). Her dad raises her like a son, even allowing her the occasional puff and swig. In sharp contrast, her regular small-town Ma, who only wants to see her daughter hitched.On a train journey, Bitti accidentally ends up devouring a novel titled Bareilly Ki Barfi and here comes a twist in the tale. Not only does she identify with the lead character of the book, she also desperately seeks the author. She starts spending a lot of time with Chirag, they become besties, too, and he promises to help find her Pritam-pyaare.Javed Akhtar’s voice-over introducing the characters and situations is breezy, once again thanks to the funny punches. Quite like the money-spinner Tanu Weds Manu and its sequel, this film too keeps you invested in its rain and shine moments. As a bonus you get the peppy Sweety Tera Drama and Twist Kamariya tracks, both of which will get you grooving. Bite into this barfi for sure; it is bound to lift your spirits."

                "p1":" When you enter the movie hall for this outing, remember to let your hair down and guffaw because from the opening scene itself you’re familiar with the tropes. David Dhawan who has made three dozen vacuous comedies, with an enviable success ratio. He was even crowned the undisputed king of comedy once. Here, he gives you a rebooted version of his 1997 comic-caper of the same name. The earlier one had Salman Khan, this one has Varun. It helps that the leading man has a mammoth following with today’s kids. And, he is viewed by those clued into Hindi mainstream cinema as a combination of Govinda and Salman, both of who carried off their kitsch routine with a certain flair. Varun doesn’t let you down either. Whether he is playing a geek or a goon, he is absolutely endearing and delivers, exactly what his daddy orders him to.The script (if you can call it that) is a combination of familiar gags borrowed from Manmohan Desai films. The sidekick stammers, the hero repeats dialogue from various masala movies, the villain develops amnesia when hit by a coconut, a football butt allows his memory to return, etc. There’s nothing intelligible here so please stop searching.It’s basically innocent fun meant to pander to the child in you. The only 'wicked’ thing here are the heroines' skimpy costumes (just kidding). The girls, Samara (Taapsee) and Alishka (Jacqueline) are brought out for chartbusters – Chalti Hai Kya 9 Se 12 and Oonchi Hai Building. They sportingly kiss, cuddle and are happy horsing around doing precious little.Lame lyrics, loud gags and leggy lasses never really hurt anyone. Believe me, at one point, you're tempted to join Varun when he is doing those perfect pelvic thrusts. Judwaa 2 could be a substitute for your Dussehra party. Consult Salman, even he sportingly shows up in a cameo in the end."
